# Optimized-Scheduler-Detector
An optimized detector in an operating system dynamically selects the best scheduling algorithm (FCFS, SJF,SRTF, or RR) based on give system. It evaluates based on waiting time and turnaround time to improve CPU utilization and ensure efficient process handling. This helps balance fairness, responsiveness, and performance in different scenarios.
